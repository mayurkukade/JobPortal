                  <p className="mt-8 text-sm">Preferable is committed to protecting your privacy. We aim to provide trustworthy, industry-leading products and services so that you can focus on building meaningful connections. Our approach to privacy is to provide you with clear information about our data practices. That’s why we've tried to keep legal and technical jargon to a minimum.</p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-sm">This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, what types of cookies are placed on your device when you visit our website and how we use them.</p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-sm">This Cookie Policy does not address how we deal with your personal information generally.</p>
              
                  <p className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What are cookies?</p>
                  <p className="mt-6 text-sm">Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your device’s memory. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your device, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our services.</p>
  
                  <p className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Are there different types of cookies?</p>
                  <p className="mt-8"><b>First-party and third-party cookies</b></p>
                  <p className="mt-2 text-sm">There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are placed on your device directly by us. For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser’s language preferences and to better understand your use of our website. Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers. For example, we use third-party cookies to measure user numbers on our website or to enable you to share content with others across social media platforms.</p>
                  <p className="mt-8 text-sm"><b>Session and persistent cookies</b></p>
                  <p className="mt-2 text-sm">There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies only last until you close your browser. We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our website during one single browser session and to help you to use our website more efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and aren't automatically deleted when you close your browser. These types of cookies are primarily used to help you quickly sign-in to our website again and for analytical purposes.</p>
              
                  <p className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</p>
                  <p className="mt-8 text-sm">Other technologies such as web beacons (also called pixel tags or clear gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes. Web beacons are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our service or opened an email that we have sent them. Tracking URLs are custom generated links that help us understand where the traffic to our web pages comes from. SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons.</p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-sm">For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as “cookies” in this Cookie Policy.</p>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-sm">What do we use cookies for?</p>
                  <p className="mt-2 text-sm">Like all providers of online services, we use cookies to provide, secure and improve our services, including by remembering your preferences, recognizing you when you visit our website and personalizing and tailoring ads to your interests.
